## Essential Operation 

`git status`

`git diff` 

`git add <FILENAME>` OR `git add .` 

`git commit -m "your commit message"` 



`git checkout <BRANCHNAME>`

`git push <remote name> <branch name>`



`git init`

`git config  --global user.username : YourGitUsernameCaseSensitive`

` git remote add <remote name> <url from github>`

`git remote set-url <remote name> <url from github>`

`git remote -v`

`git clone <url from github>`

`git push <remote name> <branch name>`

## Commit Locally

1. *`git status`*  Check status of changes to a repository

   `git diff`   View changes to files

2. `git add <FILENAME>` Add a file's changes to be committed

   `git add .`  To add all files changes       

3. `git commit -m "your commit message"` To commit (aka save) the changes you've added with a short message describing the changes

**1 is optional. You have to go form 2 to 3.**



## Remote :

`git config  --global user.username : YourGitUsernameCaseSensitive`

`git config --global user.useremail "youremail"`

 git config --global user.name "Your Name" ( for Git not Github)

#### Create

- Go to [github.com](http://github.com ),  click 'New repository'.

- Give it a name that matches your local repository's name

#### Connect 

Select  'HTTPS' and copy the address—the address of your repository on GitHub's servers. you want to tell local Git to remember the address of the remote version. 

You can have multiple remotes so each requires a name. The primary remote is typically named `origin`.

To add a remote named 'origin' to your repository:

  ```
  git remote add origin <URLFROMGITHUB>
  ```

Your **local** repository now knows where your **remote** repository, named 'origin', lives on GitHub's servers. Think of it as adding a name and address on speed dial—now when you need to send something there, you can.

**Windows Users:**
If you have **GitHub Desktop**, a remote named 'origin' is automatically created in your local repository. you'll need to tell it what URL to associate with 'origin'. 
``` 
git remote set-url origin <URLFROMGITHUB>
```

#### Push and Pull

In this case, we'll send our **branch** named 'master' to our **remote** on GitHub named 'origin'.
`git push origin master`
**Add a remote**

`git remote add <REMOTENAME> <URL>`
**Change a remote URL**
`git remote set-url <REMOTENAME> <URL>`
**View remote connections**
`git remote -v`

#### Forks and Clone

When you **fork** a repository, you're creating a copy of it on your GitHub account. Your forked copy begins its life as a remote repository—it exists just on your GitHub account, not on your computer. 

To get a forked repository from your GitHub account onto your computer you **clone** it. This cloning action copies the remote repository onto your computer so that you can work on it locally. make sure you are not in another Git repository, clone your fork:

`git clone <URLFROMGITHUB>`

type `git remote -v` to see that the address to the fork is already set up.

#### pull from upstream - the Original Repository

typically people use the name 'upstream'

`git remote add upstream 'the http address of upstream'`

type `git remote -v` to list out the addresses you have stored. 

**'origin' remote - your fork's address,****

**'upstream' remote -  address to the original**

## Branch

type `git status` to see what branch you're currently on. 

Branches are **case-sensitive** so name your branch exactly the way your GitHub name appears.

creat a branch`git branch <BRANCHNAME>`

To go into that branch:

`git checkout <BRANCHNAME>`
