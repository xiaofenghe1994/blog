exposure= number

severity: netting(offset. like A and B borrowed each other in different contract,when A default, B can also not paying A. so severity reduced)

### EL=Expected Loss

= E(Exposure)E(default)E(Severity)

### UL=Unexpected Loss

=volatility or standard deviation of credit loss

*ULportfolio^2  = UL1^2 + UL2^2 + 2 p (UL1)(UL2)*

# Midterm review

Impact of climate change on earthquake risk is not a emerging risk.

Head of underwriting does NOT typically report to the Chief Risk
Officer (CRO).

risk-adjusted return is NOT an example of a core risk measure. (don't want risk measure to get larger)

A complete eco model is not a part of ORSA risk profile.

Captive insurer not a form of governmental residual market. (not forcing. what is captive insurer? self-insured? )

Defense costs is not covered by worker's com. (? worker )
